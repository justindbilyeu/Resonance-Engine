# RM-01: Bundle Contract & Root Cleanliness

**Standard:** RM-01  
**Domain:** Bundle Structure & Repository Organization  
**Status:** Enforced (Gate G1)  
**Enforcement:** Automated via `enforce_bundle_contract.py`

-----

## Purpose

RM-01 enforces the **bundle contract** - the structural requirements that make a bundle valid, testable, and falsifiable.

This standard prevents:

- Scattered bundle artifacts making the repository unmaintainable
- Bundles missing critical files (claims without nulls, experiments without code)
- Ambiguous or unbounded claims
- Missing numeric rejection thresholds

-----

## The Bundle Contract

### Rule 1: Root Cleanliness

**No bundle artifacts may appear in repository root.**

Bundle artifacts include:

- `CLAIM.md`, `NULLS.md`, `OPERATIONALIZE.md`, `PREREG.yaml`
- `COHERENCE_METRICS.yaml`, `MANIFEST.json`, `DEVELOPER_NOTES.md`
- Runtime outputs: `*.csv`, `*_results.json`, `*_history.csv`, etc.

**Why:** A clean root keeps the repository navigable and prevents confusion about which artifacts belong to which bundle.

**Enforcement:** Gate G1 scans root directory and fails if any forbidden files exist.

-----

### Rule 2: Required Bundle Files

Every bundle in `bundles/*/` MUST contain:

1. **CLAIM.md** - Falsifiable claim (≤3 sentences)
- States what is being tested
- Bounded in scope
- Defines success/failure conditions
1. **NULLS.md** - Numeric rejection thresholds (≥2)
- At least 2 numeric thresholds that would reject the claim
- No post-hoc tuning allowed
- Thresholds must be locked before run
1. **OPERATIONALIZE.md** - Observables and estimators
- Maps every key term to a measurable quantity
- Defines measurement windows
- Specifies estimators/procedures
1. **PREREG.yaml** - Locked parameters
- Parameter sweep ranges
- Seeds for determinism
- Stopping rules
- Forbidden deviations

**Why:** These four files constitute the minimum for a falsifiable experiment.

**Enforcement:** Gate G1 checks each bundle for presence of all required files.

-----

### Rule 3: Claim Boundedness

Claims must be **short and specific** (heuristic: ≤3 sentences, ~500 characters).

**Bad claim (unbounded):**

> “This theory explains consciousness by showing that quantum coherence in microtubules creates a resonant field that unifies all aspects of awareness across multiple scales…”

**Good claim (bounded):**

> “In the RFO network with plastic coupling, there exists a ringing wedge in (K,γ) space where sustained resonance occurs under constant drive, bounded by non-ringing regimes.”

**Why:** Unbounded claims can’t be falsified. Short claims force clarity.

**Enforcement:** Gate G1 warns if CLAIM.md exceeds reasonable length.

-----

### Rule 4: Numeric Null Thresholds

NULLS.md must contain **at least 2 numeric thresholds** that would reject the claim.

**Bad nulls (vague):**

> “Reject if no clear signal is observed.”

**Good nulls (numeric):**

> “Reject if Δ_PSD_dB < 6.0 OR N_over < 2 OR r_mean < 0.35”

**Why:** Numeric thresholds prevent moving goalposts. If the threshold is locked before the run, results are either above or below it - no interpretation needed.

**Enforcement:** Gate G1 counts numeric literals in NULLS.md and fails if <2.

-----

## Enforcement Mechanism

### Automated Gate (CI)

Gate G1 runs on every push/PR via GitHub Actions:

```yaml
- name: Run Gate G1 enforcement
  run: python standards/rm01/enforce_bundle_contract.py
```

**Exit codes:**

- `0` = Pass (contract satisfied)
- `1` = Fail (violations found)

If Gate G1 fails, the PR cannot merge.

### Manual Enforcement

Run locally before committing:

```bash
python standards/rm01/enforce_bundle_contract.py
```

Fix any violations before pushing.

-----

## Violation Categories

### ERROR (blocking)

Must be fixed before merge:

- Bundle artifact in root
- Missing required file (CLAIM, NULLS, OPERATIONALIZE, PREREG)
- <2 numeric thresholds in NULLS.md

### WARNING (advisory)

Should fix but not blocking:

- CLAIM.md seems very long
- Bundle missing src/ directory
- Bundle missing tests/ directory

-----

## Examples

### Valid Bundle Structure

```
bundles/0001_rfo_ringing_wedge/
├── CLAIM.md              ✓ Present, bounded
├── NULLS.md              ✓ Present, ≥2 numeric thresholds
├── OPERATIONALIZE.md     ✓ Present
├── PREREG.yaml           ✓ Present
├── src/
│   └── experiment_*.py   ✓ Runnable code
├── tests/
│   └── test_*.py         ✓ Tests
└── README.md
```

**Gate G1:** ✅ PASS

### Invalid Bundle Structure

```
bundles/0002_broken_bundle/
├── CLAIM.md              ✓ Present
├── NULLS.md              ✗ No numeric thresholds
└── src/
    └── experiment.py
```

Missing:

- OPERATIONALIZE.md
- PREREG.yaml

**Gate G1:** ❌ FAIL (2 errors)

-----

## Rationale

### Why enforce this automatically?

**Without enforcement:**

- Bundles slowly drift from standard
- Critical files get forgotten
- Thresholds become vague
- Repository becomes messy
- Falsifiability erodes

**With enforcement:**

- Contract violations caught immediately
- No bundle can exist without nulls
- Repository stays organized
- Standards are real, not aspirational

-----

## Relationship to Other Standards

- **RM-02** (Red-Team): Assumes bundles pass RM-01 structure checks
- **RM-03** (Falsifiability): Builds on RM-01’s numeric threshold requirement

RM-01 is the foundation. If a bundle fails RM-01, other standards don’t apply yet.

-----

## History

- **v1.0** (2025-12-27): Initial implementation
  - Enforces root cleanliness
  - Requires 4 core files
  - Validates numeric thresholds
  - Automated via Gate G1
