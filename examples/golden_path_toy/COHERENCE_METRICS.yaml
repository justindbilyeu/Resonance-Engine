# Notes
notes: |
  This is a manually created golden path example for Resonance Engine v0.

  Purpose:
  - Demonstrate complete bundle structure
  - Show how null completeness gate works
  - Provide template for real experiments
  - Validate that experiments can actually run

  This example intentionally uses the simplest possible experiment (coin flips)
  to make the structure clear. Real experiments would be more complex but
  follow the same pattern.

  Key Demonstration Points:
  1. ✓ Null completeness gate passes (4 thresholds)
  2. ✓ Experiment is runnable (src/experiment.py)
  3. ✓ Tests validate null thresholds (tests/test_experiment.py)
  4. ✓ Results can be evaluated against preregistered criteria
  5. ✓ Third-party reproduction possible

  Future examples (post-v0) will demonstrate:
  - Multi-stage compilation (Builder → Skeptic → Auditor)
  - Constraint health improvement tracking
  - Dissent metrics and diversification
  - Real-world applications (LLM behavior, phase transitions, etc.)
