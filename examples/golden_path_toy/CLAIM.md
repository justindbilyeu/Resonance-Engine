# Claim

**Seed idea:** Does a simulated coin flip produce heads and tails with approximately equal probability over many trials?

## Falsifiable Claim

A simulated coin flip with probability p=0.5 will produce heads in 45-55% of trials over N=1000 flips. This range represents a 95% confidence interval for a binomial distribution with p=0.5. Any result outside this range indicates the coin is not fair.

**Constraint checklist:**
- [x] Claim is ≤3 sentences
- [x] Claim can fail in measurable ways
- [x] Scope is bounded (N=1000 trials, specific confidence interval)
- [x] Connected to operationalizable observables (proportion of heads)
