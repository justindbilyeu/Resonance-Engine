# Dissent Map: {seed}

**Generated:** {timestamp}
**Diversity Score:** {diversity_score}
**Models Used:** {models}

## Purpose

This document tracks architectural disagreement among diverse perspectives on the
research question. High dissent indicates healthy exploration; premature consensus
signals potential blind spots.

## Diverse Perspectives

### Variation 1: {model1}
**Temperature:** {temp1}
**Framing:** {framing1}

**Response:**
```
{response1}
```

**Key Divergences from Other Views:**
- [Identify where this perspective differs from others]
- [What failure modes does this view expose?]

---

### Variation 2: {model2}
**Temperature:** {temp2}
**Framing:** {framing2}

**Response:**
```
{response2}
```

**Key Divergences from Other Views:**
- [Identify where this perspective differs from others]
- [What failure modes does this view expose?]

---

### Variation 3: {model3}
**Temperature:** {temp3}
**Framing:** {framing3}

**Response:**
```
{response3}
```

**Key Divergences from Other Views:**
- [Identify where this perspective differs from others]
- [What failure modes does this view expose?]

-

### Points of Divergence
[Areas where perspectives disagree]

## Controller Decision

**Diversity Threshold:** {diversity_threshold}
**Achieved Diversity:** {diversity_achieved}
**Decision:** {decision}

**Rationale:**
[Explain why controller chose to diversify further, converge, or restart]

## Integration into NULLS.md

Based on diverse perspectives, the following failure modes should be added to
null hypotheses:

1. [Failure mode from dissent that needs numeric threshold]
2. [Another failure mode requiring testable rejection criterion]
3. [...]

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Add dissent-derived thresholds to NULLS.md
- [ ] Ensure diversity-exposed failure modes are falsifiable
- [ ] Document which perspective identified each failure mode

**Note:** This dissent map was generated by fanning out the seed idea across
multiple models/temperatures. The disagreements captured here represent
architectural diversity that prevents premature convergence on a single framing.
