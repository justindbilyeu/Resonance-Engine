# Claim

<!-- Replace this template with your falsifiable claim (≤3 sentences, bounded scope) -->

**Seed idea:** {seed}

## Falsifiable Claim

[State your hypothesis here in ≤3 sentences. The claim should be:
- Specific enough to be falsifiable
- Bounded in scope (not open-ended)
- Operationalizable (can be measured)]

Example:
> Large language models exhibit a sharp phase transition in their ability to recover from adversarial perturbations when the perturbation magnitude crosses a critical threshold. This threshold can be predicted from the model's embedding space geometry. Recovery time scales logarithmically with model size below the threshold and polynomially above it.

**Constraint checklist:**
- [ ] Claim is ≤3 sentences
- [ ] Claim can fail in measurable ways
- [ ] Scope is bounded (not "all models" or "in general")
- [ ] Connected to operationalizable observables
