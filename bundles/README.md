# Experiment Bundles

This directory contains compiled experiment bundles generated by the Resonance Engine Discovery Compiler.

## What is a Bundle?

A **bundle** is a complete, self-contained experiment package that includes:

- **CLAIM.md** — Falsifiable hypothesis (≤3 sentences)
- **OPERATIONALIZE.md** — Observable quantities + measurement protocol
- **PREREG.yaml** — Locked parameters, seeds, stopping rules
- **NULLS.md** — ≥2 explicit numeric thresholds for rejection
- **COHERENCE_METRICS.yaml** — Constraint health tracking
- **src/** — Runnable implementation
- **tests/** — Validation + null-threshold checks

## Bundle Philosophy

Each bundle represents a **preregistered, falsifiable experiment** that:

1. **Can fail** — Has explicit numeric rejection criteria
2. **Is reproducible** — Third-party replication possible from artifacts alone
3. **Is auditable** — Full decision trace from question to experiment

## Current Bundles

### [0001_rfo_ringing_wedge](./0001_rfo_ringing_wedge/)

**Status:** Complete
**Topic:** Ringing detection and falsifiability oscillation wedge
**Origin:** First proof-of-concept demonstrating the full Resonance Engine pipeline

This bundle validates that the entire stack works:
- Discovery Compiler transforms intuitive question → rigorous experiment
- Coherence Controller tracks constraint health through compilation
- Hard gates enforce falsifiability (≥2 numeric thresholds)
- Bundle outputs enable third-party replication

## Creating New Bundles

```bash
# Generate a new bundle from a research question
python -m core.discovery_compiler \
  --seed "Your research question here" \
  --output bundles/0002_your_experiment
```

See `docs/setup/` for detailed setup instructions.

## Bundle Standards

All bundles must comply with:

- **RM-01**: Epistemic rigor (preregistration, hypothesis clarity)
- **RM-02**: Red-team procedures (adversarial validation)
- **RM-03**: Falsifiability requirements (numeric rejection thresholds)

See `standards/` for full specifications.

## Bundle Lifecycle

```

Each bundle should document its full lifecycle, including failed experiments and constraint health degradation.

**Remember:** We value experiments that **fail cleanly** over those that "mostly work." The goal is geometric convergence on testable truth, not narrative coherence.
