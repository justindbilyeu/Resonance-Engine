**Version:** 1.0  
**Evidence bar target:** E3→E4 (reproducible sim with prereg + nulls; robustness sweeps)

## Claim (≤3 sentences)
In the Resonant Field Oscillator (RFO) network with a plastic coupling channel, there exists a **ringing wedge** in \((K,\gamma)\) space: a connected region where the macroscopic order parameter exhibits sustained resonance (ringing) under constant drive, bounded by non-ringing regimes at lower coupling and higher damping.  
Within this wedge, the ringing signature is **quantitatively detectable** as (i) a dominant PSD peak in the order-parameter time series and (ii) a minimum number of overshoots / hysteresis-like excursions in a redundancy/coherence metric over the same window.  
If no such region meeting the preregistered numerical criteria exists under the specified sweep, then the ringing-wedge hypothesis is rejected for this RFO specification.
